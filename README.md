Custom Cobblemon Resource Pack for the New Dawn BCG+ Server! 
This pack contains the TEXTURES of all added pokemon, NOT the spawning files.

All pokemon in this pack are NOT hidden behind any paywalls whatsoever, and are accessible to all players. 
If requested by the mod author, content will be removed.
